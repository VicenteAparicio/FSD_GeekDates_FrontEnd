# GEEKS DATE FRONT END

## Project details

### This is a React + Laravel PHP project from Fullstack Developer Bootcamp at <a href="https://geekshubsacademy.com/">GeeksHubs Academy</a> 2021.
<br>

### About
Every project is an oportunity to learn a new way to work. On this case I wanted to do my first REACT + PHP LARAVEL WEB APP ever.

Geeks Date is an webapp like tinder or adoptauntio but focused on freak people. There is a lot of webapps, android apps and iphone apps to meet your perfect partner. Sometimes that kind of apps are focused on user pics rather than their hobbies. There are a big competition out there where people who looks for more interesting partners are not welcome. There are people who wants to share their freak hobbies like watch anime, play tablegames with some friends, play videogames from the couch, do some cosplay or enjoy a nice rolegame event. This is a webapp for them.

## CONCLUSION

<br>
Geeks Dates have been one of the hardest projects on my learning. First time I had to work with REACT and PHP LARAVEL in a full project. I had to learn a lot about PHP LARAVEL, the querys and how to extract information from another tables with relations between them. I have to be very patient looking for the errors and how to fix them (very easy when you work with NODE JS).

From the begining I felt like the concept of my database and front-end was not good to this complex app. I wasn't able to see the right way to work with the tables and their relations. I spent weeks to figure out how to manage the data to get all the info I needed for the front-end area. Days with no commits fighting with the code and the big information google could provide me. Days burning my brain and my confidence about the skills I am getting over this months. 

Was a nice ride, hard but nice. I learned a lot of new stuff and thousand of ways of how not do something.

<br><br>

## THINGS I LEFT TO DO... FOR NOW

<br>
1.- Add custom alert messages<br>
2.- Improve hobbie filters<br>
3.- Add city filter<br>
4.- Add country filter<br>
